# Image Slideshow GUI

A simple Python application that displays side-by-side images ("With BG" and "Without BG") in a slideshow with full GUI controls — play/pause, next/previous navigation, jump to image number, and set custom range.  

Ideal for comparing background-removed images visually in a clean, automatic slideshow interface.

---


- View **"with background"** and **"without background"** images side by side  
- Automatic **slideshow with adjustable delay (2s default)**  
- **Play / Pause** control  
- **Next / Previous** image navigation  
- **Jump to a specific image** by number  
- **Set custom image range** to loop between selected images  
- Keeps **original image sizes** (no resizing or distortion)
